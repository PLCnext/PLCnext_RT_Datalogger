This is part of a [series of articles](https://github.com/PLCnext/plcnext-real-time-datalogger) that demonstrate how to implement a DataLogger application based on the DataLogger service provided by the PLCnext Control firmware.  Each article builds on tasks that were completed in earlier articles, so it is recommended to follow the series in sequence.

## Explore unlimited possibilites ...

This article contains some ideas for additional features that could be added to a PLCnext DataLogger application. Some of these can be implemented using patterns demonstrated in this series of articles. Others will be the subject of future articles in the PLCnext Community.

### 1. Use Modbus TCP protocol for transfer of logged data.

It is possible to provide the logged data via Modbus TCP.

### 2. Use Alarm Service for publishing of messages to the OPC UA server.

It is possible to implement a application for publishing an alarm to the OPC UA server.

### 3. Powerfull Sequent of Event system

Use the combination of the bus synchronous IO sampling in combination with the record on change option (storeChangesOnly) to create your own Sequent of Event solution within a few clicks.
